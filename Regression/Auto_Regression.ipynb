    "   -- Description\n",
    "      This data set consists of three types of entities:   \n",
    "      (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics,  \n",
    "      (b) its assigned insurance risk rating,  \n",
    "      (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars.   \n",
    "      The second rating corresponds to the\n",
    "      degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates.\n",
    "      Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its\n",
    "      price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is\n",
    "      adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this\n",
    "      process \"symboling\".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is\n",
    "      risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "      The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured\n",
    "      vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a\n",
    "      particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,\n",
    "      sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car\n",
    "      per year.\n",
